## ETS2 Telemetry 웹 서버 3.2.5 + 모바일 대시보드 한글 버전

웹소켓과 REST API에 기반한 C#으로 작성된 [Euro Truck Simulator 2](http://www.eurotrucksimulator2.com/) 와 [American Truck Simulator](http://www.americantrucksimulator.com/)를 위한 무료 Telemetry 웹 서버 입니다. 클라이언트쪽에선 최신 데스크탑과 모바일 브라우저에서 스킨을 씌울 수 있는 HTML5 모바일 대시보드 앱으로 구성됩니다. 또한 안드로이드 사용자의 경우 제공된 안드로이드 앱을 사용 할 수 있습니다만 한글화는 되지 않았습니다.

## 주요 기능

- 오픈 소스 및 무료 사용가능
- 자동 설치
- Telemetry 데이터를 위한 REST API
- 웹소켓에 기반한 실시간 telemetry 데이터 스트리밍을 위한 HTML5 대시보드 앱
- 커스텀 대시보드 스킨을 위한 강력한 지원 (스킨 튜토리얼 내장)
- Telemetry 데이터 브로드캐스팅을 위해 HTTP 프로토콜을 이용한 URL을 부여

### Telemetry REST API
  
    GET http://localhost:25555/api/ets2/telemetry

Returns structured JSON object with the latest telemetry data read from the game: 

    {    
		"game": {
			"connected": true,
			"paused": false,
			"gameName": "ETS2",
			"time": "0001-01-08T21:09:00Z",
			"timeScale": 19.0,
			"nextRestStopTime": "0001-01-01T10:11:00Z",
			"version": "1.10",
			"telemetryPluginVersion": "7"
		},
		"truck":{
			"id": "man",
			"make": "MAN",
			"model": "TGX",
			"speed": 53.82604,
			... 
    }

The state is updated upon every API call. You may use this REST API for your own Applications. 

**The complete telemetry property reference is available [here](Telemetry.md).**

Please note that GET responses may be cached by your HTTP client. To avoid caching you may use some random query string parameter or POST method which returns exactly the same result.

### HTML5 모바일 대시보드 어플리케이션
    http://localhost:25555/

This HTML5 dashboard application is designed for mobile and desktop browsers. You should be able to use the dashboard just by navigating to the URL in your Mobile Safari (iOS 8+), Android 4+ browsers (Default or Chrome) or any modern desktop browser. 

Here is a screenshot of how your mobile dashboard will look like in a browser:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Funbit/ets2-telemetry-server/master/source/Funbit.Ets.Telemetry.Mobile/skins/default/dashboard.jpg)

The package contains other photo realistic skins as well. For example, this is a skin for MAN-TGX:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Funbit/ets2-telemetry-server/master/server/Html/skins/man-tgx/dashboard.jpg)

As you can see dashboard design is completely customizable. With some basic knowledge of the HTML and CSS you can create your own skins. See Dashboard skin tutorial below for more information. 

## Setup

### Supported OS

- **Windows Vista, Windows 7, 8 or 10 (32-bit or 64-bit)**. Windows XP is not supported.
- **.NET Framework 4.5** (pre-installed in Windows 8+). If it is not installed you will be prompted to install it when you run the server. 

### Supported games

- Euro Truck Simulator 2 (32-bit or 64-bit) version 1.15+ (Steam or Standalone). Multiplayer versions are supported as well. 
- American Truck Simulator (Steam or Standalone)

### Tested browsers

- iOS 8+ running Mobile Safari (highly recommended, best user experience)
- Latest Firefox, Chrome or IE11 (Firefox or Chrome is recommended though)
- Android 4+ (4.4+ highly recommended) Default or Chrome browsers (see FAQ if you have performance issues)

### Installation

1. Download bundle by clicking **Download ZIP** button at the right side of this page. 
2. **Unpack downloaded ZIP** file *anywhere* you want.
3. Run **server\Ets2Telemetry.exe** 
4. Click "**Install**" button to perform the installation 
5. When installation finishes click "**OK**", select your network interface and click "**HTML5 App URL**" link to open your dashboard
6. **Done** (now you may read *Usage* topic to understand how to use the server)

Android users may install the provided "Ets2 Dashboard" application. The APK file is located in **mobile/Android/Ets2Dashboard.apk**. Copy it to your device and install via Android's File Manager. The application will prevent your device from going into sleep mode and will remember server IP address which is very useful if you are going to use the app frequently.

***Security notes***: The installation must be done only once and requires Administrator privileges. If you mind what exactly server does to the system at this point here is the detailed information:

1. Tries to find your ETS2 game directory and copy ets2-telemetry-server.dll plugin there
2. Creates a new Firewall rule for 25555 port named "ETS2 TELEMETRY SERVER (PORT 25555)" opened only for local subnet (i.e. it won't be visible from Internet, so you are safe)
3. Creates a new ACL rule for HTTP URL bound on 25555 port for OWIN's HttpListener ([more details](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms733768%28v=vs.110%29.aspx))
4. Creates a new file for storing application settings inside "\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Ets2 Telemetry Server".

The server also reports everything to the log file (Ets2Telemetry.log), so you may see the details there as well.

Also, if you don't trust my compiled ets2-telemetry-server.dll you may compile it by yourself using [plugin's source code](https://github.com/Funbit/ets2-sdk-plugin) and Visual Studio 2013+.

### Skin Installation

If you downloaded some third-party skin (which is folder, containing dashboard.html, css, js and image files, but **no EXE files**!) you may install it just by **copying to server/Html/skins** directory. It should appear in the skin menu as soon as you refresh your browser.

### Upgrade

If you already have a previous version installed, it is recommended to leave it as is and **unpack the new version into a separate directory**. This way you will never lose your configuration files, logs, etc. 

However, please keep in mind that if you plan to return back to previous version you have to uninstall the latest one first!

### Uninstallation

If server hasn't fulfilled your expectations and you decide to uninstall it, then:

1. Exit from the Euro Truck Simulator / American Truck Simulator
2. Select from the server's menu: Server -> Uninstall
3. Click "**Uninstall**" button in the popped up window
4. **Done**

At this moment your system will be in exactly the same state as it were before the installation. 

## Usage

1. Run **server/Ets2Telemetry.exe**  
2. Run Euro Truck Simulator 2 / American Truck Simulator.
3. **Desktop users**: connect your notebook to the same Wi-Fi/LAN network as your PC, open Firefox, Chrome or IE and navigate to the "*HTML5 App URL*" displayed by the server. 
3. **iOS users**: connect your iPhone or iPad to the same Wi-Fi network as your PC, open Safari and navigate to the "*HTML5 App URL*" displayed by the server. 
4. **Android users**: run "*Ets2 Dashboard*" application, enter server IP (*without http and port*, exactly in the same format as displayed by the server) and press OK. If IP address is correct it will be remembered for the next time.
5. **Enjoy** your mobile dashboard while playing your favorite simulator! ;)

## FAQ

> I ran the server and opened HTML5 App URL on a device but browser says "Page not found". What should I do?

First of all, make sure that your device is using Wi-Fi connection instead of mobile internet (3G, 4G, etc.). Then, make sure that you selected correct "Network interface" on the main server screen. You must select the interface that is directly connected to your Wi-Fi network, *usually* it is named as "Wi-Fi", "Ethernet" or "LAN". Also, make sure that "AP Isolation" is disabled on your Wi-Fi router ([more info](http://www.howtogeek.com/179089/lock-down-your-wi-fi-network-with-your-routers-wireless-isolation-option/)). If you still can't connect - try to temporarily disable firewalls (especially from 3rd-parties) or anti-viruses and check again. If problem persists then you should contact to your Administrator... 

> I installed provided Android application, but it always shows "Could not connect to the server" or "Disconnected" status. How do I fix that?

Please check if you can connect to the dashboard from a browser first (read the answer above). If you are able to connect via browser then there is something wrong with the application (or Android environment). You may try to restart it or reinstall.

> I started the game but dashboard is displaying "Connected, waiting for the drive..." message. What is wrong?

Please make sure that the server window is showing "Connected to the simulator" status message. If it is showing "Simulator is running" instead - then there is a problem with the telemetry plugin installation (ets2-telemetry-server.dll). If it is showing "Simulator is not running" but simulator is actually running then you have an incompatible ETS2 version.

> The dashboard UI animation (meters) sometimes stutters. Is my device not good enough? Is it possible to fix that?

The HTML5 dashboard is optimized for modern browsers and fast network connections (LAN, local Wi-Fi), so you may experience problems on old devices or devices having old web browsers. 

Some performance examples:

The dashboard will work smoothly on Samgung Galaxy Tab S (4.4.2), but not on Galaxy Note 1 or Kindle Fire HD due to slow GPU or turned off GPU graphics acceleration. To achieve the best performance on Androids you may try to use a standalone Chrome browser instead of an app (but you will need to turn off device sleep mode when you use the dashboard). 

The dashboard will work very smoothly on iOS 8.X devices (iPhone 6 or new iPads). But it will not properly work on iOS 6.X (iPhone 3GS, old iPods). If you are experiencing slow performance even on new devices you may try to close all opened apps (especially Safari) and try again, that helps a lot.

The dashboard will perfectly work on any PC or laptop inside latest Firefox, Chrome or IE11.  

Also, do not forget to turn off background downloads, especially Torrent clients, because they may dramatically slow your connection between devices!

> Is it safe to use the server? Can it crash my game? What about influence on the game performance, say FPS, processor load?

The server is written very carefully. It will not crash your game, because the telemetry plugin was created by the official developers. It also does not eat CPU (the load is less than 1%) and has small memory footprint (around 20MB). So you won't notice any difference in FPS. 

If you don't trust the compiled exe/dll files you are always welcome to check them for viruses by more than 50 different anti-virus programs on [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) site.

> Can I use mobile dashboard on Android 2.x devices?

No. There is a chance that it will work, but it won't be supported.

> Is it possible to include sleep indicator, remaining distance, ETA, current speed limit (or whatever else)?

Starting from version 3.0.0 this is possible, but I haven't yet had time to update the default skins to display it. But I will ;)
